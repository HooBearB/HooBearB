Hi there, I'm HooBearB, also known as Flint. 

<--------- And that is my cat

I don't know what I'm doing.
I make games in Python sometimes. 
Currently working on 3 games at once while finishing none, and trying to learn Java.

If you're viewing this profile you've probably been referred to this from a post on discord, but if somehow by chance you have happened upon my work and you would like to make a suggestion or comment of some sort, my discord handle is 88flynnt (was Flint#6137.)

Have a good one.
